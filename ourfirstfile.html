        <h1> Welcome to the first tutorial about Linux!</h1>
        <p1> As we all know, Linux is a free and Open source (FOSS) operating system that can be run on any platform, whether its a regular desktop PC, webservers, minicomputers, supercomputers, robots, IoT, embedded systems, and more. Due to its free and open source nature, Linux has an insanely fast growth rate, and hundreds of thousands of global corporations are constantly contributing towards the growth of this Open-source Operating System. So, what is Linux and why it has become the leading desktop OS Choice made by the entirety of the world?</p1>
        <h2> Let's dive in to the world of Linux history!</h2>
        <p2>In 1984, due to the rise of proprietary software operating systems, such as MS-DOS (Microsoft Windows' predecessor), and UNIX, an American hacker called Richard Stallman was frustrated, fearing that the Internet will soon be a locked down prison. For this reason, Stallman decided that it was time for a big change in the history of computing, so he founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and created the GNU (GNU is Not Unix) Operating System, as well as the first global Open-source license, the GNU General Public License (GPL). 7 years later, in 1991, a Finnish univeristy student called Linus Torvalds began creating the Linux kernel based on the Open-source Minix Operating System and utilized Stallman's GPL to license his newly released kernel. Soon after the release of GNU and Linux kernel, Linux was officially created, and the first two distributions, Debian and Slackware, were released in 1993. This ultimately paved the way for the foundation of multiple Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL, Arch Linux, and CentOS.</p2>
        <h3>So how can Linux rival proprietary operating systems, like Microsoft Windows or Apple MacOS?. Let's take a great example out of this: Ubuntu LTS.</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Desktop Operating Systems/Category</th>
                <th>Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS</th>
                <th>Microsoft Windows 24H2</th>
                <th>Apple MacOS Sequoia</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Features</td>
                <td>Utilizes the powerful features of GNOME 46 (Enhanced Nautilus File Manager, RDP Remote Login), Revamped Snap Store/GNOME Software Center(Flatpak), Secure Software Management, comprehensive GPO support</td>
                <td>Updated Start Menu with Phone Link, New File Explorer features, Updated Power Settings Interface, Updated Power Settings Interface, AI features for Copilot + PCs (Recall, Cocreator, Windows Studio Effects)</td>
                <td>Apple Intelligence, iPhone use from Mac, Easy window tiling, Presenter Preview, Background replacements, revamped Safari, Apple Maps and Note updates</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Security</td>
                <td> AppArmor</td>
                <td>TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, Microsoft Defender</td>
                <td>Secure Mx chips (M1, M2, M3,....), strict software restrictions</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Licenses used</td>
                <td> Free and Open Source (FOSS)</td>
                <td rowspan="2">Proprietary</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p3> After looking at this table comparison, you can see that the world is fully embracing Linux one system, one desktop computer at a time, contrast to the proprietary nature of desktop OSes like Windows and MacOS.</p3>
        <h4> Why Linux?</h4>
        <p4> Because thanks to the free and Open Source nature of Linux, anyone can patch and fix issues, as well as putting new features much faster than any proprietary software could do. This makes Linux much more inherently secure, performant, and faster time to develop, making it a perfect choice for everyone, from individuals to government agencies around the world, to start small, and grow big.</p4>
        <h5> So, let's be real: SWITCH - TO - LINUX - TODAY!</h5>
        <p5> Thank you all very much, and see you on our next blogpost!</p5>
