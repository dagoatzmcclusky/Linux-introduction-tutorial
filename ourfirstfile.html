        <h1> Welcome to the first tutorial about Linux - the most widely respected desktop/server OS in the world of technological innovation!</h1>
        <p1> As we all know, Linux is a free and Open source (FOSS) operating system that can be run on any platform, whether its a regular desktop PC, webservers, minicomputers, supercomputers, robots, IoT, embedded systems, and more. Due to its free and open source nature, Linux has an insanely fast growth rate, and hundreds of thousands of global corporations are constantly contributing towards the growth of this Open-source Operating System. So, what is Linux and why it has become the leading desktop OS Choice made by the entirety of the world?</p1>
        <h2> Let's dive in to the world of Linux history! But wait.... where shall we begin??!!</h2>
        <p2>There it is! In 1984, due to the rise of proprietary software operating systems, such as MS-DOS (Microsoft Windows' predecessor), and UNIX, an American hacker called Richard Stallman was frustrated, fearing that the Internet will soon be a locked down prison. For this reason, Stallman decided that it was time for a big change in the history of computing, so he founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and created the GNU (GNU is Not Unix) Operating System, as well as the first global Open-source license, the GNU General Public License (GPL). 7 years later, in 1991, a Finnish univeristy student called Linus Torvalds began creating the Linux kernel based on the Open-source Minix Operating System and utilized Stallman's GPL to license his newly released kernel. Soon after the release of GNU and Linux kernel, Linux was officially created, and the first two distributions, Debian and Slackware, were released in 1993. This ultimately paved the way for the foundation of multiple Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL, Arch Linux, and CentOS.</p2>
        <h3>So how can Linux rival proprietary operating systems, like Microsoft Windows or Apple's MacOS? Let's take a great example out of this: Ubuntu LTS.</h3>

        <p3> After looking at this table comparison, you can see that the world is fully embracing Linux one system, one desktop computer at a time, contrast to the proprietary nature of desktop OSes like Windows and MacOS.</p3>
        <h4> Why Linux?</h4>
        <p4> Because thanks to the free and Open Source nature of Linux, anyone can patch and fix issues, as well as putting new features much faster than any proprietary software could do. This makes Linux much more inherently secure, performant, and faster time to develop, making it a perfect choice for everyone, from individuals to government agencies around the world, to start small, and grow big. And thanks to a wide variety of contributors, such as freebies, tech savvy experts, and multinational goverment agencies such as the UN contributing directly to the Linux kernel on popular open-source repositories like Github , Linux has become the ultimate <span style="color:rgb(221, 21, 21); font-weight:bold;">Desktop OS of Choice (DOC)</span> of the entire world. That is the main reason why Linux has now become the new <span style ="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(20, 202, 81);">international standard</span> for developing every desktop/mobile applications, runtimes, and environments that we all have been using as of today, such as Docker, Electron.js, and MySQL.</p4>
        <h5>But it doesn't end there. What about the AI hype on Windows and MacOS (except Linux with no AI built-in), since AI has been introduced and widely used in every aspect of the global industry? Let's see through the reality.... </h5>

        <h5>But the point is: Does Linux have AI?</h5>
        <p4> It may not have AI built-in, but the <a href="https://flathub.org/"><b>Flathub app store</b></a> has thousands of not only free, but also Open-Source AI standalone applications for people to experience. That way, people can safely use AI responsibly and effectively in their Linux computers, without having to worry that a secret, built-in AI system might spy on people's data without their permission. Here is how you can install applications on Flathub - very easily.</p4>
